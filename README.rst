I'm enrolled in the online course of `Design and 
Analysis of Algorithms I`_, given by Tim Roughgarden for Stanford
University. I use this repo to store my own experiments with algorithms
discussed in class. I will not, however, post solutions to any
assignments or problems given in the class.

Algorithms in this repository
=============================
- mergesort.c – Implementation of `Merge Sort`_
- inversioncount.c – Count the number of inversions in an array using `Merge Sort`_
- strassens.c – A basic implementation of `Strassen's algorithm`_ for matrix multiplication
- quicksort.c – Implementation of `Quicksort`_ with support for three different pivoting strategies, namely leftmost, rightmost and median-of-three.
